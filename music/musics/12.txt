You got me deep in my emotions<br>
Drown me in your ocean<br>
Feel it every time we touch<br>
Girl, your body is perfection<br>
Give me your attention<br>
I can never get too much<br><br>

Try to numb my feelings<br>
Mix 'em with tequila<br>
'Til I'm naked on your floor<br>
In the early morning<br>
I just wanna see ya<br>
So I'm waiting at your door<br><br>

'Cause you're a goddess, girl you got it all<br>
If I'm being honest, I can't take no more<br><br>

You got me deep in my emotions<br>
Drown me in your ocean<br>
Feel it every time we touch<br>
Girl your body is perfection<br>
Give me your attention<br>
I can never get too much<br><br>

You got me deep in my emotions<br>
Drown me in your ocean<br>
Feel it every time we touch<br>
Girl your body is perfection<br>
Give me your attention<br>
I can never get too much<br><br>

You can take control<br>
Get me hypnotised<br>
Do whatever you like<br>
You got me deep in my emotions<br>
Deep in my emotions<br><br>

Catch us in the mirror<br>
Get high off each other<br>
Leave our shadows in the dust, yeah<br>
Wrap yourself around me<br>
Give it to me slowly<br>
'Til the sun comes up on us<br><br>

'Cause you're a goddess, girl you got it all<br>
If I'm being honest, I can't take no more<br><br>

You got me deep in my emotions<br>
Drown me in your ocean<br>
Feel it every time we touch (every time)<br>
Girl your body is perfection<br>
Give me your attention<br>
I can never get too much<br><br>

Get me hypnotised<br>
Do whatever you like (do what you like)<br>
You got me deep in my emotions (my, my, my emotions)<br>
Deep in my emotions<br><br>
