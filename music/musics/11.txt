Told you I'm moving out to bigger and better things<br>
Guess you never know how good you got it 'til it's gone<br>
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place<br>
The list goes on, and on, and on<br><br>

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather<br>
But there's only room for you in my world<br>
But you say that I changed like the east coast weather<br>
How the hell did I get caught up?<br>
Messin' with these LA girls<br><br>

I miss my baby<br>
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)<br>
I miss my baby<br>
Messin' with these LA girls<br><br>

I miss the days we'd take a Greyhound to NYC (NYC)<br>
Wish I could have seen that it was perfect how it was<br>
Listen, I don't want this to be the way you remember me<br>
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong<br><br>

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather<br>
But there's only room for you in my world<br>
But you say that I changed like the east coast weather<br>
How the hell did I get caught up?<br>
Messin' with these LA girls<br><br>

I miss my baby<br>
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)<br>
I miss my baby<br>
Messin' with these LA girls<br><br>

I miss my baby<br>
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)<br>
I miss my baby<br>
Messin' with these LA girls<br><br>

1, 2, 3<br>
Talk to me like, ooh ooh ooh<br>
Quit messin' with my baby<br>
Oh ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah!<br>
Ooh, ooh, oh oh<br>
Ooh, ooh<br>
